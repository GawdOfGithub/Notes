## Weapons of influence

Mother turkey will attack her own chick if it does not produces chip-chip sound and if a fake robo polecat(polecat is a natural enemy of turkey, a turkey will attack polecat if a turkey spots it near its chicks) is placed near the mother turkey installed with the chip-chip sound is placed in the nest of the turkey then the polecat will care for the chick.
A male robin attacks another male robin to mate with the female robin, what triggers the male robin to attack another male robin are  the read feathers located under  the breastplate of the male robin , but if we remove these feathers from the male robin then another male robin will not attack another male robin and in the same fashion if we create a dummy and place red feathers under the breastplate of the male robin then the male robin will attack the dummy.

A lady who sells jwellery to foreign tourists had a lot of difficulty in selling some of her jwellery so she decided to drop the prices of that jwellery to half of the original price but due to some miscommunication with her team the sales department raised the price to double the original price but something amazing happened after that her whole jwellery was sold out in a really short span of time.
Explanation of the above story --> As the foreign tourists didn't had any knowledge of the quality of the jewllery they were forced to act on a primitive response(more price = better quality) just like the mother turkey and the male robin .
It is quite obvious  that the probability of someone buying from a store will be more if they are offered discount in the form of coupons but what is quite shocking is  that the probability of someone buying will still increase if they are offered coupons but no discount/fake discount and the reason is same as in most of the cases the  customers don't have that much knowledge of the real prices of the product they use their primitive instinct that points to the fact --> (coupon = discount).

## Contrast Principle
Emily and Emma are really close friends both are really attractive and they always hang out together.But the problem is men are approaching only Emily for a date and completely ignoring Emma.
Can you guess the reason ?
The answer lies in Contrast Principle .
Emma is really attractive but men are not finding her attractive as she is always a hanging out with Emily and Emily is shadowing Emma.
In an experiment subjects were asked to rate a girl out of 10 on the basis of their  appearance and the response was recorded in two different situations -
Situation 1: The picture of the girl was directly shown to the subject.
Situation 2: A picture of a supermodel was shown to the subject before showing the picture of the girl and then the response was recorded.
In all experiments the average rating of the girl was quite higher in situation 2 then compared to situation 1.
Sales people always use contrast Principle on us. 
When we visit a clothing store to purchase clothes the sales person shows us the most expensive clothing available in case if we buy the clothes then he can sell us add ons with ease (belt,matching purse etc.) and if we refuse to buy that expensive clothing then he will show us less expensive clothing then the initial clothing it's a win-win for the sales person.
Here the sales person is using contrast principle as in first case we already have bought an expensive clothing then the cost of add on will appear menial to us and in the second case if we refuse to buy that expensive clothing then  the probability of us buying the next clothing that the sales person will offer will increase as it will appear cheap to us (contrast principle at its best).
Professional automobile sales person use the same principle they first sell us the car at relatively lower price compared to their competition and once if sign the contract we are bombarded with add ons(car cleaner,fancy tires etc. ) and we happily buy them as the add ons appear really cheap when compared with the car itself.

## Reciprocation Principal
A psychology professor did an experiment , the experiment was as follows he asked the subjects to visit an art gallery with him and among the subjects one of the person disguised as the subject was the assistant of the professor .During a short break time the assistant returned with two coco cola bottles one for him and one for the subject and after that the assistant asked the subject to buy lottery tickets from him .This same experiment was repeated but with a slight change, during the second experiment the assistant did not brought any coco cola bottles with him and after the break he asked the subjects to buy lottery tickets from him.
The result was quite shocking , people in first case bought twice the number of tickets as compared to the second case , but more shockingly even the people who did not liked the assistant also bought the tickets from him despite not liking him.
Krishna society was struggling with donations in the states as for an average American the people from Krishna society are a bit weird(shaved head and an unfamiliar attire) but due to religious reasons members were hesitant to change their ways so instead they used reciprocation principle, members of Krishna society approached people in the street with a flower or a Bhagvat Geeta(religious book of Hindus) and placed the flower on the clothes of their target or handed the Bhagwat Geeta to them and if the target refused the polite gesture the member of the Krishna society  simply said that it's a gift from us you it's up to you whether you donate or not. But here reciprocatory principle came into play the target was forced to donate to the society as it would be really rude to not return the favour done by the member of the Krishna society and the target felt obligated to donate.
After applying this stratergy the donations received by Krishna society in the states skyrocketed.

The free sample/free trial works also uses the exact same principle.-->
A supermarket was having difficulty with selling their cheese so what they did was they put all the cheese in the display and asked the people to cut a slice of  cheese and try it for themselves for free.What happened next was really interesting all the cheeese was sold in a very short span of time.

During ww1 a german soldier was ordered to go to the enemy trench and capture an enemy soldier on reaching the enemy trench the enemy soldier offered the German soldier a bread which was the only thing he had, this resulted the German soldier's heart to melt down and he did not captured that soldier and returned to his trench empty handed.

Reciprocation is a psychological phenomenon - if one does not reciprocates(returns the favour) then he will feel a mental debt in his mind which will bring uneasiness to him.


## Stories in favor of rejection then retreat phenomenon
1.A boy scout asks the author to buy ticket for a boy scout event but the author denied it, then the boy scout asks the author to buy boy scout bars from it and the author buys it.


2. There were two control groups-->
1.In group 1 professor made a request to the college students to spend two hours per week as a councellor to a juvenile deliquent for a minimum of two years(100% of them refuses) and then he makes a smaller request to the college students compared to the first request he asks them to accompany a juvenile deliquent for a zoo trip for free( 83% of them agreed).
In group 2 professor directly requested some other college studentes to accompany a juvenile deliquent for a zoo trip for free(only 17% of them agreed)

2.Car salesman who first showed expensive cars to their clients before showing the affordable ones made more money compared to the car sales person who directly showed affordable cars to their clients.

**A case study which combines rejection then retreat principle with responsibility**
Imagine that John and Jay wants to divide 100 dollars among themselves but there is a twist if they are unable to divide this amount between themselves then no one gets anything but the important part is that John is a frequent reader of Blog_Buster so what he does is he says to Jay he is going to keep 80 and give John 20.John pushes back and after Jay arguing more and more,John softens and agrees to give 40 dollars to Jay and keeps 60 dollars in his pocket.You will feel that Jay should be angry on John for this unfair deal but on the contrary Jay will be happy from his perspective he was able to make John agree to take home less amount compared to his initital amount.So in his mind Jay is thinking that he is good at negotiating.

#Consistency Principle
"It is easier to resist at the begining compared to the end"
We first take a decision then we justify it
1. Horse better are confused before placing a bet on a horse but research has shown that the confidence of the better on the horse increases once the better has made a decision of betting on a certain horse the reason is in his mind he starts justifying his decision.

## How toy companies made millions using consistency principle
1.During Christmas the sales of toys increased by a lot but the problem which the toy company faced was that sales of toys drastically decreased after Christmas to resolve this issue they played a nice trick what they did was they undersupplied the toys to stores which were in high demand during the Christmas so parents weren't able to provide that specific toy to their kids so instead of that toy the parents bought an alternative toy for their kids for Christmas. 
Now the real magic happened after Christmas as the parents had already promised their kid before Christmas that they will buy the toy which the kid want to play with in Christmas but the parents were not able to be consistent with their words as the toy was not available in the market at that time so even after buying a different toy for their kid during Christmas they were no satisfied due to the consistency issue so what they did was they bought the toy which were they unable to buy previously after Christmas so that they can be consistent with their words.

2. How non profit orgs use your consistency to get a yes from you?
A research was conducted in which two groups were 
## Commitment is the key
1. A social pyschologist wanted to test an approach so he did the following his objective was to ask the residents of a society to volunteer for a social cause which was spending three hours collecting donations by going door to door for three hours.
So he first created two groups Group A and Group B
For the people in group A he directly asked them to volunteer for the social cause 
But for the people in group B he first just went from door to door and he told the residents of the society that he is running a survey and the survey which needs you to answer only one question - if you were asked to volunteer for a social cause will they do so?
Then one week later professor sent his lab assistant to meet group B 
Result-->
Group B volunteered 700% more compared to Group A for th social cause.

2. People who were trying to ask for charity followed two approaches -->
Approach 1: People in X place are not ok please help them by donating.

Approach 2: 
Charity Team Guy:Hi Sir how are you?
Target:I am ok 
Charity Team Guy: Sir I am really glad to know that I am ok but I would like you to tell that people in X are not okay and they really need your support
Approach 2 generated 32% more compliances compared to approach 1.

3. How Chinese communists were able to change the behaviour of American war prisoners?
Chinese soldiers were able to accomplish this impossible looking feature here's what they did-->
Chinese asked these soldiers to write stuff like what are the problems that they face in America and then asked them the American Soldier to sign them. 
The Chinese conducted essay writing competition in the prisoner camp among the american prisoners and shockingly pro American essays with a little bit of soft corner for the commmunists were declared as winner of the competition and the prize was as as small as a cigggar or a fresh fruit.
So how these Chinese were able to change the behaviour of American soldiers -->
The prizes for these essay writing competition were kept small on purpose so that the thought that what he did was to grab the prize this is not what he really feels to summarize in one line Chinese were trying to convince the American soldier that whatever the soldier is doing , he is doing according to his own free will. 
Moral of the story --> If you are able to convince someone that whatever he is doing is doing because of his own free will then they will do whatever you ask them not because you are asking them to do so but because now they are acting as per their free will.

Now this stratergy can be used for both good and bad but I believe that you will use this stratergy for good only
-->
Companies will do whatever to convert you from prospect to customer 

Foot and the Door Technique -->
1. First sell small stuff then the bigger one 
eg-
Again time for a small case study
Time for testing a new approach
Approach 1 on Group 1 :-> A social psychologist asks the folks from  first group to allow his team to insert a very big bill board for public service which stated drive carefully
Approach 2 on Group 2 :-> The social psychologist asks the folks from second group to allow his team to place a very small three inch bill board for public service which stated the same in their lawn and after one week the professor returned and made the similar request to the home owners of the Group 2 which was made from the Group 1 to insert a bill board that will say drive carefully in their lawn.
Approach 3 on Group 3 :-> Assistant of social psychologist  asks the folks from third group to sign a petition which stated that the people agree to beautification of the city.Two weeks after this incident the professor payed them a visit and asked them to install that big board in their front lawn which stated to drive carefully.
Results
Approach 1 on Group 1:-> 17% people agreed to the request
Approach 2 on Group 2:-> 76% people agreed to the request
Approach 3 on Group 3:-> 50% people agreed to the request
The most fascinating thing is that 50% of the people in group 3 agreed to the request despite beautification of the city and drive carefully has nothing in commmon and the reason for this was --> 
The petition changed the self image of the individuals from normal citizens to citizens who care about public welfare.
