--> Imagine that you want to send a cold e-mail to an influencer so while sending a cold email send along a little gift along with it , it could be as small as a genuine appreciation, offer gratitude or even you can offer help even you can go one level deeper and figure out how can you help the person who you are writing an e-mail do that service for them and attach that in your cold email. For example if you are a thumbnail designer and you want to contact an influential youtuber then you can send a cold e-mail to him and attach the link to the thumbnail you created for them in the cold e-mail
A better strategy would be to to just genuinely appreciate the youtuber  in the cold e-mail and attach your work along with them as a token of thanks for creating such amazing content and do not ask anything from them. It will increase your chances of hearing back from them.
Do the same thing with all the youtubers that you genuinely appreciate and you want to work with this will increase your likelihood of hearing back from them.
Once you hear back from any of the influencer you use the second stratergy which is known as **rejection then retreat** stratergy , it basically states that ask for a big offer from your target and as obvious it is the target will reject that offer once rejected ask for a relatively small offer .
Continuing the story of John--> 
Now John the thumbnail designer asks the youtuber to design all the thumbnails for him from now on and if the influencer accepts that request then it's a win for John and if the youtuber rejects that requests then it's time for applying **rejection then retreat** now John makes a smaller request to the youtuber , he asks the youtuber to allow him to design the thumbnail for any  one of his video and give him some credits for that there is a high probability that you will hear a yes from him in case even this stratergy fails then we will use our final stratergy  here you will ask him for a content creator who is looking for a thumbnail designer and ask him to connect you with him or vouch for John.




Actionable steps to consistency principle -->
1. If you want to motivate an employee/friend to do some work then you can say that you have done same kind of stuff in the past so you can pull this off even now.
