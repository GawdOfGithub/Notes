# _ It is not over until your life is over so keep on performing the right actions without caring about probability- Take actions which have probability of high returns in long term.
# _ Results doesn't matter but the process does.
# _ Over a very long period of time if your process is right than probability will favour you and you will get what you deserver
# _ Eliminate news from your life as news glorify the result instead of the process
# _ Take the path in your life in which you are sure that you will probablistically win in the long term.
