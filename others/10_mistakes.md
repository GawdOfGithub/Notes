# 10 biggest mistakes that I have done until now while learning web development

# 1. Got stuck in tutorial hell
Tutorials feels really great you code along with the tutor you are building really cool projects you are learning a lot you feel a lot of confidence in yourself but there's a problem if I told you that I am a professional cricketer and you ask me that from where have I acquired that skill and I reply back to you that I have acquired it from watching professional cricketers playing it  consistently for 10 years , for sure after hearing this you would laught at me but when it comes to coding everyone is making (including me) so often that it has got a teerm tutorial hell. The biggest problem is we think that we are really smart and we will get it all by just watching tutorials but that is far from reality.
#2. Took too much time to say bye to windows and hi to linux
