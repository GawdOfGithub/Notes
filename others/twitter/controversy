Recently I watched the open source drama which started with theo positing a video on how people are abusing open source by contributing meaninglessly to repositories. I would like to share my personal experience regarding this drama in this thread -->
In my initial days of web development I was really inspired by Harkirat and Kunal and thought of learning web development so that I could crack GSOC as tbh everyone around me was doing that. But later I realized that I was wrong I didn't enjoyed contributing to open source one bit because of the following reasons -->
1. I never used any of the open source projects that frequently appeared in GSOC so I wasn't able to relate with them.
2. My final motive is to become a true IndieHacker, so why should I learn legacy tech that it is becoming more and more obsolete as we speak.
So what's my take on Open Source -->
My philosophy regarding open source is same as mentioned by @mehul in one of his videos --> Contribute to only that open source projects that you are familiar with and use frequently I also liked theo's take on Open Source where he mentions that instead of raising garbage PRs focus on building your own projects and once you come across a real issue that you face yourself while using any open source proeject then reproduce that issue and then ask for help from that specific open source community.
