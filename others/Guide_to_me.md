# This is the advice that I would have given to my younger self who was just getting started at web development

## 1).Believe me you are not growing you are just in tutorial hell
 Stop watching tutorials and tagging along by copying the code  from the tutorial and start building. I know you are not able to build your dream project on your own but don't worry start small build a small todo list , if you get stuck than read documentation, Unable to solve bugs look for solutions in github but build stuff yourself that's the only way you can grow.

 ## 2). Drop windows and shift to linux based OS
 I know you think that's it a lot of effort you would have to learn operating all together a new OS but believe me it's worth the effort. You would be able to develop better and faster. First it would be difficult but later it will become wonderful, better performance, shell scripts will become your best friend and development will become much more easier.

## 3).Strong fundamentals easy life, wrong fundamentals tough life
I know that you are thinking that you will not be writing css yourself and you will be focusing on the libraries like tailwind or material ui while designing but strong fundamentals like flex and positioning(in css) , (useState,useEFfect and useRef) in react or (different methods) in javascript will make you unstoppable.It's just like chess you learn how each piece works in isolation than you can win any game by building on top of the basics. 

## 4). I am not getting it let's leave it this is not for me 
Believe me you will get it you just need to spend more time with it. Keep on trying the more you will try the more you will fail , the more you fail the more pain you will feel but failures will lead to growth and  growth will lead to satisfaction.

## 5). In web development either you are in pain or you are not growing
The current project you are working on must always be complex than the last project you made. And for sure this will cause pain but as I said earlier this pain will eventually lead to growth. So always stay in pain , one day you will reach a level when everything will look really easy ( I haven't achieved that level yet but I believe strongly in this)

## 6). Never take anything personally
Your design sucks because you are a beginner, next time when you show your webapp to a non developer friend  and he/she says it sucks than instead of taking it personally ask him/her why and then improve. One day your design will still suck but it will suck less.

## 7). Learn Git and github asap 
Upto this day I have worked with various technologies they keep on changing new technologies come and old ones go away but one thing that remains constant that I use github everytime I write code . It helps me to colaborate with other developers and it will also help you to ask doubts from your fellow developers.

## 8). Apply in DCC as a web developer
I know you are thinking that it is a waste of time and nothing good will come out of it and sometimes you are thinking that you will not be able to make in due to high competition but getting selected is not in your hand ,the only thing in your hand is applying. Joining DCC will lead to real growth it will put you in a room where everyone is smarter than you (be it seniors or fellow mates) and that will lead to growth. For the first time you will be writing code that will be used by hundred's of users under the mentorship of your seniors(who are way better than developers than you.)

## 9). Don't contribute just for the sake of contributing
Contribute in those technologies that you use and are facing issues with but if you are not facing any issue any tech than don't contribute. Then just keep on learning and experimenting. Don't run behind the fame or money as promised by open source contributions (don't chase the hype ) it will not benefit in the long run.

## 10). Don't compare yourself to others
Your learning style is unique, your motivations and interests are different . Instead of folowing a path keep on experimenting with different paths you will fail a lot and people will say you are wasting your time but believe me you are wasting time but this wastage of time is equivalent to a sailor waisting time just before discovering gold.
